**pymatcal** is a Python implementation of the ray-tracing-based analytical calculation of system response matrix of a single photon emission tomography system. 

Key features of the project are:

- **Almost 100% Numpy-based.**

Transition to a CUDA capable system should be easy with Python packages like `CuPy <https://cupy.dev/>`_

- **It is written in an MPI-ready style.** 

With the help of `mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, we can run the calculation in parallel with a short Python script.

- **System matrix I/O can be handled with** `h5py <https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/>`_ **package.** 

The package provides a convenient API for writing data in parallel with MPI.

The following image shows the PPDFs of a single pinhole detector unit. The detector system consists of a single pinhole and a detector system. The image is generated by the `pymatcal` package.
